    "* *for loops* perform a process a set number of times (e.g. n number of times, where n is equal to the number of records in an object)\n",
    "* *while loops* perform a process indefinitely until a certain condition is met/a certain condition is no longer met\n",

    "2. When you are working with some kind of data structure with a difficult to determine size (e.g. a server that is streaming live data)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you decide to implement a *while loop*, then there are **two things you must ensure** (and which are not required for for loops):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You've included a condition which instructs the program to break outside of the loop (once condition is met)\n",
    "2. You are highly confident that the condition (for breaking outside the loop) *will actually occur*\n",
    "\n",

    "NumPy is an abbreviated name for *Numerical Python* and is a (if not THE) leading package for high-performance scientific-computing and data analysis. It provides many useful components, two of which are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **ndarray** - N-dimensional arrays (row x column x levels) providing capability for vectorized operations\n",
    "    * Very similar to the arrays we learned about during the R training. Although the Pythonic notation and syntax is different, the concept is the same.\n",

    "\n",
    "Pandas is a Python package that provides data structures that enables Python to efficiently handle large amounts of data from different sources. \n",
    "\n",
    "Key features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Easy handling of missing data\n",
    "- Size mutability: columns can be inserted and deleted from DataFrame and higher dimensional objects\n",
    "- Automatic and explicit data alignment: objects can be explicitly aligned to a set of labels, or the data can be aligned automatically\n",
    "- Powerful, flexible group by functionality to perform split-apply-combine operations on data sets\n",
    "- Intelligent label-based slicing, fancy indexing, and subsetting of large data sets\n",
    "- Intuitive merging and joining data sets\n",
    "- Flexible reshaping and pivoting of data sets\n",
    "- Hierarchical labeling of axes\n",
    "- Robust IO tools for loading data from flat files, Excel files, databases, and HDF5\n",
    "- Time series functionality: date range generation and frequency conversion, moving window statistics, moving window, linear regressions, date shifting and lagging, etc.\n",
    "- Source: (http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/fonnesbeck/Bios8366/blob/master/notebooks/Section2_1-Introduction-to-Pandas.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pandas Documentation\n",
    "Before we take a look at the exciting world of Pandas you should know how to get some help.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas has very good online documentation for almost all of the DataFrame / Series methods and functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "This can be found here: http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/\n",
    "\n",
    "Google and Stack Overflow also have a plethora of helpful Panda's resources. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Pandas Data Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas has two main data structures: the series (one-dimensional) and the data frame (two-dimensional)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Series\n",
    "\n",
    "A Pandas series is like a list in that it is one dimensional and can handle data of different types. However, unlike a list which is bound to a numerical index a Pandas series can have a more meaningful index.\n",
