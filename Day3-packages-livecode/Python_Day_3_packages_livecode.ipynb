    "## What Is There to Manage?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Anaconda Python Distribution makes life a little easier when getting started with Python as it comes preconfigured with many of the most popular Python packages for data analysis. However, you will come to a point where a package you'd like to use is not included and so you will have to download and install it. Furthermore the packages you use will continue to develop and include new features over time, which will require you to update your packages. All of this, and more, is broadly defined as **package management**- and there are tools to make it a simple task.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conda Install\n",
    "\n",
    "The Anaconda Python Distribution has its own package manager called **conda**. The complete documentation available within the [Conda User Guide: Managing Packages](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-pkgs.html), and we will review some of the key commands below.\n",
    "\n",
    "*It is important to note that you will be running these commands within the **terminal or Anaconda Prompt***\n",
    "\n",
    "Also there is a concept of 'environments' within Python, which is a way to have different versions of Python and associated packages all on the same machine. We will skip this for now, but it is mentioned because if you maintain different environments then you will want to specify which environment you are managing. If this is something you want to explore then the [Conda User Guide: Managing Environments](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) is a good place to start.\n",

    "### Search if a package is available for installation\n",

    "\n",
    "## Pip Install\n",
    "\n",
    "Pip is another recommended tool for Python package management which exists independent of Anaconda (although it is included in the distribution and they work in conjunction). Typically you will use the pip install for packages that you cannot download with conda. \n",
    "\n",
    "Again we will cover the basic commands, but it is worth looking through the [Pip documentation](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/), especially the *Quickstart* section.\n",

    "\n",
    "This training is by no means an exhaustive exploration of Python, but rather a capable introduction meant to peak your interests and begin your journey into Python programming. You might not be an expert *Pythonista* (yet!), don't fool yourself: you now know enough about Python to start writing scripts and developing programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't believe it?! Let's prove it by working together through a coding exercise in which you will touch upon the following:\n",

    "* A little bit of Numpy operations\n",
    "* Defining your own function!\n",
    "* Data I/O\n",
    "\n",
    "Open the *Live_Code.py* file with the Spyder IDE. Using the commented instructions as a guide, we will practice writing a program to read-in data, operate on DataFrames, perform a quintile analysis, and write the results back to disk.\n",

    "*Don't overthink this exercise, the task can be completed in less than 30 lines of actual code*\n",
